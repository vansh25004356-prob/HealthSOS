# HealthSOS – Emergency & AI Healthcare App

## Overview
HealthSOS is an iOS-based healthcare application designed to provide instant emergency guidance, AI-assisted health awareness, doctor consultation support, mental wellness assistance, and daily health tracking in one integrated platform.

This repository contains **project documentation only**.  
Due to healthcare data sensitivity and ongoing development, the source code is maintained privately.

## Problem Statement
During medical emergencies or health issues, people often panic and lack reliable guidance. Existing healthcare apps usually focus on only one aspect such as fitness tracking or consultation, leaving users without a unified healthcare support system.

## Proposed Solution
HealthSOS provides:

- Emergency first-aid guidance
- AI-based health awareness (non-diagnostic)
- Doctor consultation connectivity
- Mental healthcare support
- Nutrition, skin & hair care guidance

The goal is to help users take the **right health decision at the right time**.
